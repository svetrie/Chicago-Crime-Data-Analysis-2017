# Chicago Crime Data Analysis Project

Analyzed Chicago's crime data during 2017 to identify patterns in crime and locate the most problematic regions within Chicago. Created visualizations to display findings as well as an interactive web app that allows users to explore the data for themselves. Project also includes a final report that contains interpretation of results as well as a general overview of the analytical methods used to obtain them. All code was written in R and the web app was created using R's Shiny Library.
